# methyPre
Methylation array preprocessing.

This package is downloadable using the following in R:   
`require(devtools);   install_github("metamaden/methyPre")`

## Purpose
This package contains a single wrapper function that serves as an all-in-one workflow assembly. It takes an experiment summary object as used in minfi (eg. RGChannelSet, MethylSet, GenomicRatioSet, etc.) and applies minfi normalizations, filters, and batch correction. The workflow decision tree, including all arguments and operations, is as follows:

## NEWS/TODO
### 1/20/18 
Improvements planned: consider contingencies or exceptions and add more messages. Consider adding an estimate for object size and enabling a user interaction (whether to accept or decline based on available memory, the list objects get huge pretty quickly).
